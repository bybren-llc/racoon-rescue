# 1. NAVY PETTY OFFICER FIRST CLASS (E-6)

## Rank Overview
- **Pay Grade:** E-6 (Noncommissioned Officer)
- **Abbreviation:** PO1
- **Equivalent Ranks:** Staff Sergeant (Army/Marines), Technical Sergeant (Air Force)
- **Monthly Pay (2015):** Approximately $2,800-3,400 depending on time in service

## Rank Insignia
- **Design:** Perched eagle ("crow") above THREE chevrons pointing down
- **On White Uniforms:** Dark blue (almost black) eagle, rating symbol, and chevrons
- **On Navy Blue Uniforms:**
  - Eagle and rating symbol: WHITE
  - Chevrons: RED (standard) or GOLD (if 12+ years of good conduct service)
- **Cap Device:** E-6 specific device with eagle

## Typical Age & Experience
- **Minimum Time in Service:** 5-7 years to reach E-6 at fastest possible pace
- **Typical Age Range:** Late 20s to mid-30s (most common: 27-35)
- **Time as E-5 Required:** Minimum 36 months (3 years)
- **High Year Tenure:** Can serve until 20 years at E-6

## Responsibilities & Character Traits
- Marks transition from "junior" to "senior" petty officer
- Often serves as **Leading Petty Officer (LPO)** of a division

- Delegates and oversees work; only executes most difficult/complex tasks personally
- Mentors junior petty officers
- Responsible for subordinates' well-being, performance, and professional development
- Beginning to prepare for advancement to Chief Petty Officer (E-7)
- Should be qualified in all in-rate watchstations

## What This Means for Your Character
A PO1 is NOT a young hothead - they've been in 7+ years, have real responsibility, and are being groomed for Chief. This makes a DUI situation particularly devastating to their career. They would be mortified, not cavalier. They know better - which makes the situation more tragic/comedic.

## 2015 Uniform Notes
- **Working Uniform:** NWU Type I (blue digital camouflage) was standard in 2015
  - Note: Type III (woodland) was restricted to ground units until late 2016
- **Service Uniform:** Service Dress Blues or Whites depending on season
- **Off-duty/civilian clothes** would be most common for a bar scene

# 3. BREATHALYZER INTERLOCK DEVICES

## Physical Description
- **Size:** Approximately the size of a cell phone (2015 era)
- **Components:**
  - Handheld unit with mouthpiece
  - Digital display screen
  - Cord/cable connecting to vehicle's ignition system
  - Electronic Control Unit (ECU) installed under dashboard
- **Mounting Location:** Typically on or near dashboard, driver's side
- **Appearance:** Small, discreet, detachable handheld device

## Visual Reference for Props
- Resembles a chunky handheld breathalyzer
- Mouthpiece extends from top or side
- LED/LCD digital display
- Connecting cord runs to dashboard area
- Often has buttons for operation
- Some models have camera for photo verification

## The Blow Procedure - STEP BY STEP

### Pre-Start Test
1. Driver picks up handheld unit
2. Takes breath, prepares to blow
3. **Typical Pattern (Intoxalock-style):**
   - Blow for 1-2 seconds
   - Inhale for 1-2 seconds
   - Final blow for 3-4 seconds
4. **Alternative Pattern (some brands):**
   - Blow while humming at specific frequency
   - Maintains specific pressure for several seconds
5. Device analyzes breath sample
6. Display shows result (PASS/FAIL or BAC reading)
7. If PASS (usually below 0.02 BAC): Vehicle starts normally
8. If FAIL: Vehicle will NOT start, lockout period begins

### Rolling Retests (While Driving)
1. Device beeps/alerts randomly during drive
2. Display shows message: "TEST REQUIRED"
3. Driver has several minutes to provide sample
4. Must blow while maintaining safe driving
5. If PASS: Continue driving normally
6. If FAIL:
   - Vehicle does NOT shut off (safety feature)
   - Horn may honk continuously
   - Lights may flash
   - Violation logged
   - Must pull over and turn off vehicle

## Technical Details
- Uses alcohol-specific **fuel cell sensor**
- Platinum catalytic electrode causes oxidation reaction
- Generates electric current proportional to alcohol content
- **Calibration Required:** Every 30, 60, or 90 days (state-dependent)
- All data logged and reported to authorities
- Tampering attempts are detected and reported

## Comedy/Drama Potential
- The blow pattern itself looks awkward/embarrassing
- Random retests while driving create tension
- Device logs EVERYTHING - creates paper trail
- Calibration appointments = mandatory check-ins
- Failed test = car won't start = very public humiliation

# 5. RACCOON BEHAVIOR

## When Cornered or Threatened

### Initial Response - Warning Signs
1. **Freeze:** Holds still, hopes threat passes
2. **Posturing:** Makes self look bigger/scarier
3. **Vocalizations:**
   - Hissing
   - Growling (guttural quality)
   - Barking
   - Screaming/shrieking
   - Chattering
4. **Physical Display:**
   - Elevates and thrashes tail wildly
   - Fur stands straight up (piloerection)
   - Rounds/arches back
   - Leaps up and down repeatedly
   - Bares teeth
   - Standing tall, swaying side to side

### If Warning Is Ignored
A cornered raccoon WILL attack. They are:
- Surprisingly strong for their size
- Armed with sharp claws
- Have strong bite force
- Will not hesitate to engage

## What Would Happen If SQUEEZED or GRABBED

### Immediate Physical Reactions
Based on real attack accounts and behavioral research:

1. **Violent struggling** - twisting, writhing
2. **Biting** - will bite whatever is closest (hands, arms, face)
3. **Scratching** - all four paws have sharp claws, will rake attacker
4. **Screaming/shrieking** - loud, disturbing vocalizations
5. **Possible defecation/urination** - stress response/defense mechanism
6. **Will NOT let go** easily once engaged in defense

### Real-World Account
One attack victim described grabbing a raccoon by the tail:
- The raccoon "had hold of [the victim's] head at that point and didn't want to let go"
- Required pulling and spinning the raccoon by its tail
- Had to "spin around twice in a circle, swinging the raccoon by its tail to try to build momentum and keep it away from my body"

## Realistic Scenario for Film

If character grabs/squeezes raccoon:
1. Raccoon would immediately bite and claw
2. Would NOT go limp or passive
3. Screaming and hissing throughout
4. Character would likely be bitten on hands/arms
5. Possible scratches to face if raccoon gets close
6. Raccoon would fight until released or exhausted
7. Once released, would likely flee OR attack again if still cornered

## Health Concerns (For Realism)
- Raccoons can carry rabies (though not common in urban CA)
- Bites and scratches require medical attention
- Would need hospital visit after encounter
- Possible rabies post-exposure prophylaxis

## Comedy Potential
- The escalating vocalizations (hissing to screaming)
- Unexpected strength of small animal
- The "it won't let go" factor
- The possibility of getting "sprayed" (stress defecation)
- Character's shocked reaction to being bested by trash panda

# 7. CREATIVE LICENSE NOTES

## Where Accuracy Matters Most

### HIGH PRIORITY - Get These Right
1. **E-6 Insignia:** Three chevrons with eagle - easy to verify
2. **IID Blow Procedure:** The awkward blow-inhale-blow pattern is inherently comedic but real
3. **Raccoon Aggression:** They WILL fight back - this is non-negotiable for believability
4. **Oceanside as Military Town:** The vibe of dive bars and military culture

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Be Accurate
1. **Legal Consequences:** General framework is correct, specific sentences vary
2. **2015 Tech:** Avoid obvious anachronisms (no AirPods, no TikTok)
3. **Navy Uniform Details:** If shown, should be correct

### LOW PRIORITY - Creative License OK
1. **Specific Bar Names:** Can fictionalize if needed
2. **Exact Legal Procedure:** Dramatic license acceptable
3. **Specific Base Locations:** Can be vague about Camp Pendleton specifics

## Potential Authenticity Issues to Watch

### "Abuse of Public Animal"
- This exact charge doesn't exist in California
- Options:
  - Use "wildlife harassment" (real but weak)
  - Use "animal cruelty" (real, more serious)
  - Keep fictional charge for comedy (acceptable for dark comedy)
  - Have character THINK they're being charged with this (confusion adds comedy)

### Navy at Camp Pendleton
- Need brief justification why Navy sailor is at Marine base
- Simple fix: "stationed at Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton"
- Or: "attached to [Marine unit] as corpsman"

### Interlock Device Timeline
- IID would be installed AFTER conviction, not immediately
- Creative license: Could have prior DUI, already on IID
- Or: Could be part of pre-trial release conditions

### Raccoon Lethality
- A healthy adult could probably "win" fight with raccoon
- But would NOT escape uninjured
- Bites and scratches guaranteed
- Hospital visit would be necessary aftermath

## Suggested Background Details

### For Protagonist (PO1)
- Age: 29-32 (realistic for E-6 with 8-10 years in)
- Rate (job): Corpsman (HM1), Admin (YN1), or IT (IT1)
- Assignment: Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton or base command
- Living: Off-base apartment in Oceanside
- Vehicle: Older sedan with IID installed (suggests prior trouble)

### For Setting
- Season: September (still warm, summer feel)
- Day: Friday or Saturday night (liberty)
- Location: Downtown Oceanside bar district
- Time: Late evening, after drinking
