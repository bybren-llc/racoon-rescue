 two characters at the same time. I n a sense, working with 
Heroes and Villains flattens these two relationships into a 
single relationship. This often confuses an audience, as they are often not s ure which of the two relationships is being 
described by a particular moment between the two characters.  
What’s more, it is easy for an author to leave holes in each kind of relationship because if something happens in one of 
the two, its dramatic moment um can carry the attention past 
a gap in the other. In fact, it is the foundation of a Melodram a 
for the audience to accept as a style that gaps in both relationships are ac ceptable, as long as the combined 
momentum of them both carries the attention on to  the next 
point in either.  
To avoid audience confusion and prevent your drama from  
disintegrat ing into a Melodrama, you 
may wish to split up either the Hero, the Villain, o r both. When both are 
split, it allows for a complete 
separation of the functional re lationship and the personal 
relationship, allowing for each to be fully developed by the 
author and experienced by the audience.  
When only one character is split, the two relationships 
converge on the remaining character. So, we might have a story with a Hero (Main Character/Protagonist) who has a 
functional relationship with the Antagonist and a personal 
relationship with the Obstacle Character. This forms a “V” shaped pattern which is referred to as a Dramatic  Triangle.

ALWAYS WRITE FROM YOUR HUNGER 
It has been rumored that Mario Puzo  
wrote the Godfather t o get out of 
gambling debts... If that’s true, not 
too shabby for a talented hungry 
guy! However, write what you love, write a movie  that you enjoy writing. 
Write something that you would pay money to see. Then try writing a movie that you would never dream 
of writing. Don't be afraid to write from hunger; meaning "writing for money."  Some people make a lot of money 
writing commercial  scripts. It's nice to be paid for what you 
love to do, don't be ashamed t o say tha t you like b eing paid.  
Mike & I  get paid to write, We’re  proud that we get paid to 
write... but, we both hate the business end. We both write for 
ad agencies, animation com panies and write coverage for 
other writers, gags for TV sp ots, and so on,  for all this… We 
get paid. That's why it's good to be surrounded by good 
people who are looking out for you.  But, when it comes down to it, we just love to write...  
Rem
ember this : unless you are "A Big Name" screenwriter 
with big -multi -bucks deals, the odds of your selling your 
script are low. If you write from your heart and don't sell a 
thing, you still have your soul... It may be a little worn out , 
but... If you choose to be a s creenwriter, you better grow a 
thick skin.  If you are fragile and sensit ive this is not the 
business fo r you.  Now go sell your Script !

 WHAT IS A 'BEAT'?  
A beat is a sort of a parenthetical in a musical sense; it’s 
used to show a pause or a brief moment  of silence.  
 
SAL 
Magoo, how the hell are you? 
(beat) 
Whoa, aren’t you supposed to be dead? 
                            
REMEMBER! The beat allows time for the words to sink in. mark it.  When you need a  heavy beat,  try to show what's happening during t hat beat:  
 
SAL 
Magoo, how the hell are you? 
 
Magoo chuckles apprehensively. 
 
SAL (cont.) 
Whoa, aren’t you supposed to be dead? 
 
For me this is too subtle, but it works.  
 
WHAT IS A VOICE OVER ? 
Voice -overs  are sometimes looked down on as cheating, 
insinuati ng that you are looking for a quick fix; That's an 
extreme view, born in film schoo ls. when properly done,  
Voice -overs are a great way to convey or explain your story, 
it's a great tool to keep in your pocket.:  Watch: Casino, 
Goodfellas and Blade Runner they are great examples.  
  
FLASHBACKS  
Like voice- overs Flashbacks are sometimes looked down on 
as well. A Flashback can be a powerful cinematic tool,

 allowing the filmmaker to sends back through time, re- visit a 
historical event, set up a back -story, a reaso n why 
something is happening in the present and so on. Unless 
you intend it to be  silly, watc h not to make the flashback 
cheesy. Again, If don't propel the story, don't use it.

6.PROTECTING MY WORK
*NOTE – WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU LEGAL ADVICE , JUST INFORMATION .
YOU S HOULD ALWAYS CONSULT WI TH YOUR ATTORNEY.  
TO
O MUCH CAUTION I S GOOD!  
Maintaining legal control  of your work is critical. While the 
incidence of screenplays being ripped off are probably over 
estimated, it does happen. Yet, a preoccupation about being ripped off can be a negative influence for a writer.  
During the development of the screenplay a para noid writer 
will find themselves cut off from any support system such as feedback  from other writers and participation in workshops.  
During the marketing phase when the objective is to get the  
work read,  every event will  cause panic.  
My a
dvice is to ta ke the point of view that IF you are ripped 
off, and can prove it, you'll likely make more money through 
a plagiarism suit than you would have in selling your first spec screenplay. Writing screenplays  and dealing with a vast 
movie industry is hard enough with out becoming paralyzed 
with fear. You should take efforts to protect your work,  then 
relax.   

--- PAGE 81 ---

RICH GOTERI & MIKE MILI 
74 MAINTAIN A CREATIVE TRAIL  
The prudent screenwriter  will take some simple steps  which 
create an electronic and or hard copy paper trail of your 
project's develo pment . Doing so,  could be helpful if you ever 
have to establish your authorship  during a copyri ght 
infringement case.  
Dat
e work as it develops and files it --even if it's messy and 
you hope no one will ever see it. An occasional hard copy should be printe d out, dated and stored somewhere. How 
long should you store these early drafts? As  long as the  
projec t remains unsold and viable.  
Var
ious drafts can also be saved electronically as separate 
files with a reference date. To avoid cluttering up your Hard Drive with these, and possibly entering the realm of mass 
confusion, save them to a floppy disk and store somewhere 
safe.  
If you participate in workshops or writer's groups, or are pitching your project as you develop the screenplay, it is imperative that yo u have dates, names and occasions when 
you presented the ideas underlying the screenplay. Of course, you would also keep track of those who read your work or may have had access to it. I suggest a running, chronological diary. This is very important if y ou are ripped 
off since a plagiarism suit requires proof that there was access to your material .  
ID
EAS BELONG TO EVERYONE (SORT OF)  
According to copyright law ideas cannot be owned and it's not possible to get statutory copyright for an idea. What is actually owned by the writer is the rendering of the idea. 
However, it's a gray area w here an idea changes over into a 
rendering of that idea as is obvious by the many suits filed in the entertainment industry  over ideas.  

--- PAGE 82 ---

WORDS TO FILM BY 
75 Because ideas, concepts, outlines, and  scenarios cannot be 
copyrighted the Writer's Guild of America provides a 
registr ation service to assist writers. This service does not 
establish statutory ownership but is accepted by the courts as establishing the date at which you possessed the materi al 
being registered. Since many plagiarism disputes hinge on 
who possessed the idea(s) first th is service is ver y helpful to 
the screenwriter.  
Keep
 in mind that ideas come and go. Sometimes writers 
unknown to each other have similar idea s. There are ideas  
in the air. The more concrete, expanded and elaborated your 
idea is the better off  you are.  
STA
TUTORY PROTECTION  
Once you've completed your screenplay, having a copyright issued for it is your best protection. While copyright protection is established by the act of creation, legal 
statutory ownership is established only by applying for and being granted a copyright for the screenplay.   
If yo
u’re developing a script you should  have no exposure to 
the entertainment indus try, until you’ve  completed the f inal 
draft and filed. However, if your first draft will be passed around for early marketing or  comments, then you should 
probably formalize protection by applying for a copyright on the first draft prior to putting it out  there. All the new material 
in a rewrite can be covered with a revised filing.  
If you elect to not copyright your f irst draft, you should get 
copyright coverage for your finished screenplay prior to beginning your marketing efforts. Registering a copyright for your script is proof of owner ship and puts a copy of your 
screenplay in the Library of Congress. Information o n 
copyright and the appropriate forms are available at the 
Office of Copyrights on line as well.  

--- PAGE 83 ---

RICH GOTERI & MIKE MILI 
76 ADVICE  
The Writer's Guild Registration Service allows you to register 
mater ial. Some people advise that a first draft and a finished 
screenplay be registered.  However, since you can get actual 
statutory copyright for your screenplay there is nothing to be gained by filing a copy with the WGA. The re are possible 
advantages in regi stering your scripts or ideas with the 
Guild.  We usually register our  scripts first  with the US  
Copyright Office and then with the WGA.  
Be a
dvised that mailing a copy to yourself provides NO 
protection. Use the WGA Registration Service for material which  can not be granted a copyright for one reason or 
another .  
Remember! If you don’t Copyright your work, someone else ultimately will. 
Go t
o the US Copyright Office  website  for a copy PA Form : 
http://www.copyright.gov/for ms/  
You can get  an idea  of copyri ght law by reading Circular 1.

77 WHAT  IS A COPYRIGHT?  (excerpt from Circular 1)  
Copyright is a form of protection provided by the l aws of the 
United States to the authors of “ original works of 
authorship,”  including literary, dramatic, musical, arti stic, 
and certain other intellectual works. This protection is 
available to both published and unpublished works. Section 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right t o do and to authorize others to 
do the following:  
• R epr
oduce the work  in copies or phono- records
• P repare derivative  works based upon the work
• D istribute copies or phono- records  of the work  to
the public by sale or other  transfer of ownership, or
by rental, lease, or lending out
• P erf
orm the w ork publicly , in the case of literary,
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and otheraudio
-vi
sual works
• D isp
lay the work  publicly, in the case of literary,
musical, dramati c, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial,  graphic, or sculptural
works, including the individual images of a motionpicture or other audiovisual work .
• P erform the wo rk publicly (in the case of sound
recordings*) by means of  a digital audio
transmission
In ad
dition, certain authors of works of visual art have the 
rights of attribu -ti
on and integrity as described in section 
106A of the 1976 Copyright Act. For further information, see Circular 40, Copyright Registration for Works of the  Visua l 
Arts. 
WHO
 CAN CLAIM COPYRIGHT?  
Copy
right protection subsists from the time the work is cre - 
ated
 in fixed form. The copyright in the work of authorship  
im
mediately becomes the property of the author who cre - 
ated
 the work. Only the author or those deri ving their rights  
through the author can ri ghtfully cla im copyright.

In the case of works made for hire, the employer and not  
the employee is considered to be the author. Section 101 of  
the copyright law defines a “work made for hire” as:  
 
1a. work prep ared by an employee within the scope of 
his or her employment; or  
 2a. work specially ordered or commissioned for use as:  
•  a contribution to a collective work  
•  a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual  work  
•  a translation  
•  a supplementary  work 
•  a compilation  
•  an instructional  text 
•  a test  
•  answer material for a test  
•  an atlas  
 If the parties expressly agree in a written 
instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.   
 
T
he authors of a joint work ar e co-ow
ners 
of the copyright in the work, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.   
C
opyright in each separate contribution to 
a periodical or other collective work is 
distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole and 
vests initially with th e author of the contribution.

86 NON- DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT 
A non -disclos ure agreement, or NDA, is a document that states that one 
party agrees not to  reveal the confidential information that it knows abo ut 
the other party. This creates a trail for the screen writer, in case the 
producer or one of his associates decides to make the project on his own 
or create something similar.  It’s a simple reassure th at they’re going to 
steal your idea.   Here ’s the non-d isclosure agreement I use:

P A R A N O I A  
Being overly paranoid of theft cou ld 
actually be more detrimental to you than 
taking the “risk” of responsibl y sending 
your properly protected work into the world.  
Most industry people, even other screen writers  really have 
no interest in stealing your original idea because they have 
origin al ideas of their own.   
 
Being afraid to shop your screenplay or treatment  will more 
than likely hurt more than help your cause bec ause you’ll 
miss the creative inspiration of teamwork and reassurance.  
Worrying so much that you can’t submit your screenplay  to 
industry professionals  might just be a self -defeating. A fter all, 
many other screenwriters are submitting their wor k and 
doing great . The key to the big  picture  is to proceed with 
your eyes wide open and a healthy amount of caution.
