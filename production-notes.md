---

## 11. MUSIC & SOUND DESIGN NOTES

### TONE

The film walks a tonal tightrope: genuine despair in the opening transitioning to absurdist comedy. Sound design should support this journey.

**Opening (Bar - Parking Lot Discovery):**
- Sparse, melancholic
- Diagetic sounds dominate (glass clinks, distant jukebox)
- Danny's isolation emphasized through silence

**Middle (Chase - Capture - Driving):**
- Building tension
- Comedic rhythm in sound effects
- Raccoon sounds as punctuation

**Climax (Attack - Crash):**
- Chaos
- Overlapping sounds
- Impact and silence contrast

**Resolution (Aftermath - News):**
- Comedic deflation
- Return to naturalism
- Ironic counterpoint possible

### KEY SOUND MOMENTS

| Scene | Sound Element | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Bar | Distant jukebox | Source music; period appropriate |
| Parking Lot | Wind; gravel crunch | Isolation |
| Breathalyzer | Digital beeps | Clinical; unforgiving |
| Dumpster | Rustling; lid creak | Suspense/comedy blend |
| Raccoon | Chittering; hissing | Distinct personality |
| Chase | Footsteps; panting | Comedy timing |
| Truck Interior | Engine; struggle | Claustrophobic |
| Driving | Road sounds; night ambiance | Brief calm |
| Attack | Screaming (both); chaos | Over-the-top |
| Crash | Fence splinter; splash; silence | Impact contrast |
| Underwater | Muffled; bubbles | Surreal moment |
| Cops | Radio chatter | Reality returns |
| News | Studio ambiance | Controlled/artificial |
| Final Shot | Night sounds; satisfied chitter | Full circle |

### MUSIC RECOMMENDATIONS

**Option A: Minimal Score**
- Sparse piano or guitar
- Only in transitions
- Let sound design carry
- Budget-friendly

**Option B: Comedic Underscore**
- Light orchestration
- Mickey-mousing the raccoon
- Classic comedy feel
- Moderate budget

**Option C: Ironic Needle Drops**
- Licensed tracks at key moments
- "Peaceful" music during chaos
- Requires licensing budget
- High impact if done well

**Recommendation:** Option A or B for budget tiers under $75K. The script's comedy is in the situation; music should support, not oversell.

### SOUND EFFECTS - SPECIAL NOTES

**Raccoon Vocalizations:**
- Record library raccoon sounds
- Consider recording session with real animal
- Layer sounds for "personality"
- The final "chitter" is the punchline - must be perfect

**Breathalyzer Device:**
- Design distinct, memorable beeps
- "SAMPLE REJECTED" voice: cold, robotic
- "VEHICLE ENABLED" should feel like victory

**Truck Crash:**
- Layer: fence splinter, water entry, metal stress, glass break
- Moment of silence before splash
- Underwater transition to muffled

---

## 12. POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

### EDITORIAL

- **Estimated Cut Length:** 12-15 minutes
- **Pacing:** Builds from slow/melancholic to frenetic comedy

- Driving: Cooler suburban night
- Pool: Underwater blue contrast with warm deck
- Day scenes: Naturalistic
- News: Bright, artificial TV lighting
