## CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS

### PETTY OFFICER FIRST CLASS DANNY VEGA (32)

**First Appearance:** Scene 1
**Introduction Beat:** Hunched over a bar, nursing his eighth whiskey, staring at a crumpled Dear John letter. His uniform is impeccable but his eyes tell a different story.
**Character Essence:** A good man at the end of his rope. Not a villain, not an idiot - just a guy who made one bad choice that snowballed. The audience should wince at his decisions while understanding why he makes them.
**Arc:** Denial -> Desperation -> False Victory -> Humiliation -> Resignation

### BANDIT (The Raccoon)

**First Appearance:** Scene 3
**Introduction Beat:** A pair of glowing eyes in the darkness. Then: a fat, confident raccoon emerges from a dumpster, completely unbothered by the world. He is king of this trash heap.
**Character Essence:** An agent of chaos. Nature personified. He doesn't seek revenge - he simply IS. The raccoon represents everything Danny can't control.
**Arc:** Unbothered -> Captured -> Unconscious -> VENGEANCE -> Unbothered

### HOMEOWNER (GERALD, 58)

**First Appearance:** Scene 9
**Introduction Beat:** Bathrobe, slippers, reading glasses still on. He stands at the edge of his destroyed backyard holding a phone, mouth open, trying to process the truck sinking in his pool.
**Character Essence:** The innocent bystander. The normal world that Danny's chaos invades.

### NEWS ANCHOR (JESSICA CHEN, 35)

**First Appearance:** Scene 10
**Introduction Beat:** Professional veneer cracking as she reads the police blotter. She's seen a lot, but this is a new one.
**Character Essence:** The Greek chorus. She represents the audience's reaction.

## SCENE-BY-SCENE BREAKDOWN

---

### SCENE 1: THE BAR

**INT. DUSTY'S BAR - NIGHT**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Page Count | 1.5 pages |
| Time | Approx. 11:45 PM |
| Tone | Melancholy, quiet desperation |
| Purpose | Establish character, stakes, and emotional state |

**STORY BEATS:**

1. OPEN on a crumpled letter. We see fragments: "I can't wait anymore..." "...someone who's actually here..." "...I'm sorry, Danny."
2. Pull back to reveal DANNY at the bar. Nearly empty. A BARTENDER wipes glasses.
3. Danny orders "one more." The bartender hesitates, serves him anyway.
4. LAST CALL announced. Danny checks his watch. Realizes he has to drive back to base.
5. He leaves cash, pockets the letter, and heads for the door.

**KEY DIALOGUE:**

- Bartender: "You got a ride, Chief?"
- Danny: "I got a truck."
- Bartender: "That's not what I asked."
- Danny doesn't answer.

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- Warm but dingy lighting. Beer signs provide the only color.
- Danny's uniform should be visible but not featured - he's Navy, but tonight he's just a man.
- The letter should be visually prominent but never fully readable.

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** Sympathy. We feel for Danny before we judge him.

---

### SCENE 2: THE TRUCK (BREATHALYZER)

**EXT. DUSTY'S PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Page Count | 1.5 pages |
| Time | Midnight |
| Tone | Growing frustration, dark humor emerging |
| Purpose | Introduce the central problem |

**STORY BEATS:**

1. Danny crosses the gravel lot to his PICKUP TRUCK. It's seen better days.
2. He fumbles with keys, drops them, picks them up. Clearly impaired.
3. Climbs in. Keys in ignition. The ENGINE CRANKS but a DIGITAL BEEP stops him.
4. CLOSE ON: A BREATHALYZER INTERLOCK DEVICE mounted on the steering column.
5. Danny stares at it. He forgot. Of course he forgot.
6. He blows. RED LIGHT. DENIED.
7. He waits. Blows again. DENIED.
8. He SLAMS the steering wheel. Checks his phone. No one to call.
9. He sits in defeated silence. Then - RUSTLING from the darkness.

**KEY DIALOGUE:**

- Danny (to himself): "Come on. Come on, come on, come on..."
- Device: *BEEP* "SAMPLE REJECTED. PLEASE WAIT."
- Danny: "I'm gonna die in this parking lot."

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- Sodium vapor lights casting orange glow
- The breathalyzer device should look clinical, almost medical - a constant reminder of past mistakes
- Danny's reflection in the rearview mirror - disappointed in himself

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** We recognize the trap. He did this to himself, but we still don't want him to suffer.

---

### SCENE 3: THE DISCOVERY

**EXT. DUSTY'S PARKING LOT - DUMPSTER AREA - CONTINUOUS**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Page Count | 1 page |
| Time | 12:05 AM |
| Tone | Curiosity shifting to dark inspiration |
| Purpose | Introduce Bandit, plant the terrible idea |

**STORY BEATS:**

1. Danny exits the truck, follows the sound.
2. Behind the bar: a commercial DUMPSTER. The lid is askew.
3. Movement inside. Danny approaches cautiously.
4. BANDIT emerges. Fat, confident, a pizza crust in his tiny hands.
5. Man and raccoon lock eyes.
6. The raccoon doesn't run. He CHEWS. Maintains eye contact. Dominance established.
7. Danny watches the raccoon breathe - in, out, in, out.
8. CLOSE ON: Danny's face. The idea forming.
9. He looks back at his truck. Back at the raccoon.
10. A terrible smile.

**KEY DIALOGUE:**

- Danny (quietly): "Hey there, buddy."
- Bandit: *aggressive chewing*
- Danny: "You're not drunk, are you?"

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- Raccoon eye-shine in the darkness - almost supernatural
- The dumpster should feel like Bandit's kingdom
- Danny's expression should shift from "what is that" to "wait a minute" to "oh no, this might work"

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** The audience should realize what Danny's planning before he says it. The comedy comes from watching the terrible idea take root.

---

### SCENE 4: THE HUNT (PART ONE)

**EXT. DUSTY'S PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|

- Sound design: Danny's heavy breathing, raccoon chitters, gravel crunching

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** Pure comedy. The audience should be laughing, but also developing respect for the raccoon.

### SCENE 5: THE HUNT (PART TWO - THE TRAP)

**EXT. DUSTY'S PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|

**KEY DIALOGUE:**

- Danny (to pizza box): "Nobody can resist cold pepperoni."
- Danny (mid-pounce): "GOTCHA!"
- Danny (looking at scratches): "Worth it. Totally worth it."

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- The trap sequence should be shot like an action movie - dramatic angles, slow-mo on the pounce
- Danny's face when he realizes he's actually holding a wild raccoon - momentary terror
- Blood visible on Danny's forearms - the raccoon got some licks in

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** Triumph undercut by "what now?" Danny won, but at what cost?

---

### SCENE 6: THE BLOW (MIDPOINT)

**INT. DANNY'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|

- Danny (after squeeze): "Oh God. Oh no. I killed it. I killed a--"
- Bandit: *wheeeeze*
- Device: *BEEP* "SAMPLE ACCEPTED. VEHICLE ENABLED."
- Danny: "...holy shit."

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- CLOSE UPS: Danny's face, Bandit's face, the breathalyzer tube
- The green light should feel HUGE - almost religious
- The unconscious raccoon on the floorboard should be visible, ominous

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** This is the false victory. The audience knows this can't end well. The unconscious raccoon is a ticking time bomb.

- Danny: "I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be--"

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- Calm, steady shots - contrast to the chaos before and after

- HANDHELD, CHAOTIC, almost horror-movie energy
- Raccoon POV shot - spinning, furious
- Blood on the windshield (Danny's)
- SOUND: The raccoon's scream is unearthly, demonic

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** Pure chaos. The audience should be laughing and horrified simultaneously.

- Gerald: "What... what in the absolute..."
- Danny: "I can explain."
- Gerald: "That's my pool."
- Danny: "...there was a raccoon."
- Gerald: "There's a TRUCK."

**VISUAL NOTES:**

- The fence destruction in SLOW MOTION - beautiful and terrible
- Underwater cinematography - the truck settling, bubbles rising, headlights dimming
- Wide shot of the aftermath: the destruction is TOTAL
- Bandit's exit should feel almost triumphant - he survived, unbothered

**EMOTIONAL BEAT:** The crash should feel like the end of the world, then pivot to absurdist stillness.

## TONAL GUIDANCE

### Overall Tone

**Fargo** meets **Reno 911** with a touch of **A Simple Plan**. The humor emerges from the absurdity of the situation and the characters' matter-of-fact responses to escalating chaos.

### What We're NOT Doing

- Winking at the camera
- Mocking Danny (he does that to himself)
- Cruelty toward the raccoon (Bandit wins in the end)
- Slapstick without stakes

### What We ARE Doing

- Playing it straight while the situation goes insane
- Finding the humanity in terrible decisions
- Letting silence and stillness amplify the chaos
- Respecting the audience's intelligence
