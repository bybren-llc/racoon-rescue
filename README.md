## Storyline

A drunk Navy petty officer can't start his car—the breathalyzer interlock won't let him. His solution? Capture a raccoon from a nearby dumpster and use it to blow into the device.

It works. The raccoon passes out. Danny drives away triumphant.

Then the raccoon wakes up.

Based on a true incident from Camp Pendleton, California, *Racoon Rescue* is a dark comedy about desperation, bad decisions, and the unstoppable force of nature's pettiest revenge.

## Plot Summary

DANNY VEGA, a Navy Petty Officer First Class, sits alone at a dive bar near Camp Pendleton. It's his last night before deployment, and a Dear John letter burns in his pocket. His wife found the ring he never gave her. She's with someone named Marcus now.

Drunk and stranded, Danny stumbles to his truck only to be denied by the court-mandated breathalyzer interlock—a reminder of past mistakes. He can't call anyone. His ex deleted. His buddies on base. His card maxed out.

Then he hears rustling from the dumpster.

BANDIT, a fat and confident raccoon, sits among the trash, completely unbothered by the drunk sailor watching him. A terrible, beautiful idea forms in Danny's alcohol-soaked brain.

What follows is a slapstick chase, a desperate capture, and one unconscious raccoon successfully fooling a breathalyzer. Danny tosses the limp creature onto the floorboard and peels out—a genius, he thinks.

Two minutes later, Bandit wakes up. And Bandit is angry.

The raccoon attacks. Danny loses control. The truck explodes through a white picket fence and lands in a suburban swimming pool.

As Danny sits in the shallow end, covered in scratches and chlorinated water, Bandit paddles to safety and waddles off into the night—unbothered, undefeated, and absolutely done with humanity.

## Genres

- Dark Comedy
- Short Film
- Based on True Events

---

## Themes

- **Desperation breeds bad decisions**: Danny isn't evil—just trapped and too impaired to see any good options
- **Nature always wins**: Bandit is the true protagonist; he survives and thrives while Danny's life implodes
- **Consequences compound**: One bad choice leads to another leads to disaster

---

## Tone

*Fargo* meets *Reno 911*. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the matter-of-fact way it escalates. We're not mocking Danny—we're watching a man dig himself deeper with every decision, unable to stop.
