## 4. LOCATION LOGIC

### Geographic Flow Analysis

```
Bar Interior (Dusty's Bar)
    |
    v [CONTINUOUS - exits door]
Parking Lot (outside Dusty's)
    |
    v [CONTINUOUS - behind bar]
Dumpster Area (same location)
    |
    v [CONTINUOUS - same parking lot]
Various points in parking lot (chase)
    |
    v [drives away]
Residential Streets (Oceanview Estates)
    |
    v [crashes through fence]
Homeowner's Backyard / Pool
```

**Geographic Status:** LOGICAL

- Bar to parking lot: Immediate exterior (CONTINUOUS appropriate)
- Parking lot to dumpster: Behind same building (CONTINUOUS appropriate)
- Parking lot to residential: Driving transition (scene break appropriate)
- "Oceanview Estates" sign establishes new location
- Crash sequence flows logically through fence to pool

**Location Continuity:** CLEAN

## 7. PRIOR DUI CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS

### The Concern (from Story Analyst)

The treatment states: "court-mandated from a DUI two years ago. The irony isn't lost on him: he beat one charge, cleaned up his act, and now this."

This implies:
1. Danny had a prior DUI
2. He has an IID installed
3. Yet he is drinking and driving again

### Script Handling

The screenplay handles this elegantly:

1. **Line 62:** The IID is described as "a constant reminder of past mistakes" (plural)
2. **Line 70:** "He forgot. Of course he forgot." - Implies this is a lapse, not habit
3. **Line 15 (enhanced):** The Dear John letter mentions "six years of anniversaries alone" and "I found the ring in your sock drawer, Danny. Three years ago" - establishing long-term relationship strain

### Continuity Assessment

The script does NOT explicitly state Danny had a prior DUI. The IID could be:
- From a prior DUI conviction (as treatment states)
- From a plea bargain / pre-trial condition

**The "contradiction" is actually NOT present in the screenplay itself.** The treatment provides backstory that the script leaves ambiguous. This is acceptable - the IID's presence is self-explanatory to audiences.

**Recommendation:** No change needed. The screenplay wisely avoids exposition about the prior DUI, letting the device speak for itself. If clarification is desired, a single line could be added, but it is not required for continuity.

**Prior DUI Status:** NO CONTRADICTION IN SCRIPT

---

## 8. ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED

### Issue 1: Inaccurate Legal Charge

- **Type:** Research accuracy / legal terminology
- **Location:** Line 491 (Epilogue - Arrest scene)
- **Original:** "...unlawful interference with wildlife."
- **Problem:** This specific charge does not exist in California law. Research document flagged this.
- **Fix Applied:** Changed to "...wildlife harassment."
- **Status:** FIXED

This now aligns with California Code of Regulations 251.1, which makes it illegal to "herd or harass" any wild animal.

---

## 9. MINOR NOTES (No Fix Required)

### Note 1: Broom Abandonment
The broom Danny grabs (line 168) is not explicitly dropped. However, his fall on the asphalt (lines 187-191) provides implicit justification for abandoning it. No audience member will question this.

### Note 2: Danny's Wounds
Danny accumulates wounds throughout (scratches lines 228, 236-238; bites lines 257, 364; general bleeding line 433). The epilogue shows him still wet but does not explicitly show wounds. This is acceptable as he is wrapped in a shock blanket (line 484).

### Note 3: Time Jump to Morning
The SMASH CUT from night crash to morning arrest (line 480-482) is a significant time jump but is clearly marked. This is intentional storytelling, not an error.

## CONTINUITY ASSESSMENT: PASS

This screenplay demonstrates strong continuity discipline. The single issue found (inaccurate legal charge) has been corrected. The story analyst's concern about "prior DUI contradiction" was investigated and found to be a non-issue - the screenplay handles this ambiguously and appropriately.

**Final Status:** Script is continuity-clean and ready for production breakdown.
