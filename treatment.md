### ACT ONE: THE SETUP

**PETTY OFFICER FIRST CLASS DANNY VEGA (32)**, a career Navy man with a spotless record, sits at a dive bar near Camp Pendleton. It's his last night before deployment. He's been drinking—too much—mourning a Dear John letter crumpled in his pocket.

The bar closes. Danny stumbles to his truck in the parking lot. He slides behind the wheel, keys in ignition. The ENGINE CRANKS but won't turn over. He forgot about the BREATHALYZER INTERLOCK DEVICE—court-mandated from a DUI two years ago. The irony isn't lost on him: he beat one charge, cleaned up his act, and now this.

He blows into the device. **DENIED.** Again. **DENIED.**

Danny slumps. He can't call anyone—not his ex, not his buddies already asleep on base, not his commanding officer. He's stuck.

Then he hears it: RUSTLING from the dumpster behind the bar.

### ACT TWO: THE PLAN

Danny investigates. A fat RACCOON—let's call him **BANDIT**—is elbow-deep in trash, completely unbothered by the drunk sailor watching him.

A terrible, beautiful idea forms in Danny's alcohol-soaked brain.

*What if the raccoon blows into the breathalyzer?*

What follows is five minutes of slapstick chaos as Danny attempts to capture Bandit. The raccoon is faster, smarter, and meaner than expected. Danny gets scratched, bitten, and humiliated—but he's committed now.

Finally, using a bar towel and an empty pizza box as a trap, Danny corners Bandit. He holds the furious creature up to the breathalyzer tube.

The raccoon, surprisingly, BLOWS. Maybe it's a hiss. Maybe it's a scream. Whatever it is, the interlock reads it as breath.

**APPROVED.** The engine roars to life.

Danny tosses Bandit onto the passenger floorboard—too drunk to think about releasing him—and peels out of the parking lot.

### ACT THREE: THE RECKONING

For two glorious minutes, Danny thinks he's gotten away with it. He's driving home. He's a genius. He's—

Bandit wakes up.

The raccoon, having been SQUEEZED unconscious during the breathalyzer ordeal, regains consciousness with a vengeance. He launches himself at Danny—clawing, biting, screaming that unholy raccoon scream.

Danny loses control. The truck SWERVES through a quiet suburban neighborhood—

CRASHES through a white picket fence—

And comes to rest IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IN-GROUND SWIMMING POOL.

The truck sinks. Danny scrambles out, covered in scratches, bite marks, and chlorinated water. Bandit—that survivor—paddles to the edge and waddles off into the night.

Porch lights flick on. A HOMEOWNER in a bathrobe stands at the edge of his destroyed backyard, phone already dialing 911.

Danny sits in the shallow end, water up to his chest, watching his truck bubble and sink.

### EPILOGUE: THE AFTERMATH

Split screen of consequences:

- Danny in handcuffs, being processed for DUI, reckless driving, destruction of property, and "abuse of public animal"
- Bandit, back at the dumpster, eating trash like nothing happened
- The HOMEOWNER explaining to his insurance company that a truck is in his pool
- A LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR barely containing laughter as she reads the police blotter

**TITLE CARD:** "Based on a true story. The raccoon was never found."

**FADE OUT.**

## THEMES

- **Desperation breeds bad decisions** - Danny isn't evil, just trapped and too impaired to see any good options
- **Nature always wins** - Bandit is the true protagonist; he survives and thrives while Danny's life implodes
- **Consequences compound** - One bad choice (drinking) leads to another (the raccoon plan) leads to disaster

## TONE

Think **Fargo** meets **Reno 911**. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the matter-of-fact way it escalates. We're not mocking Danny—we're watching a man dig himself deeper with every decision, unable to stop.

## VISUAL STYLE

- Nighttime, sodium-vapor parking lot lighting
- Handheld camera during the raccoon chase
- Slow-motion for the pool crash
- Static, wide shots for the aftermath—let the destruction speak for itself

## RUNTIME

Estimated 12-15 minutes as a short film.
